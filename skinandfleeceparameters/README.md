# Skin and fleece parameters #
The subdirectory _skinandfleeceparametrs/ab3220_ contains an analysis of an experimental flock  which was maintained by CSIRO over the period 1974-1984. It contains important measurements of the fibre diameters of primary and secondary fibres which are not available elsewhere, as well as a copmprehensive range of skin and fleece measurements.

Analyses from other flocks will be added to the _skinandfleeceparametrs_ subdirectory in due course

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of the inheritance of fleece characteristics and its consequences for sheep selection methods. This has to include fleece quality as well as quantity and an understanding of how the two should e put together in a selection goal.
