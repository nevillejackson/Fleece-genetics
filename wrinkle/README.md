# Wrinkle-genetics #
The subdirectory _wrinkle_ contains a document _wrinkle.pdf_ which is a compendium of what is known about the genetics of wrinkle score in Merino sheep. It is meant to be the starting point for a broader investigation of all the factors involved in woolgrowing surface area of a sheep.

## What next? ##
There are good and not-so-good ways of adding to the woolgrowing surface area of a sheep. It is unfortunate that Australian Merino breeders have historically chosen to use increased wrinkle or skin folds.  A better approach would be to develop a loose skin (larger than the body size) without wrinkles. This has been tried in the SRS Merino. It seems to work, but there is litle data on its full range of consequences for sheep production. There is also a lack of biological understanding of skin development with and without wrinkles.
