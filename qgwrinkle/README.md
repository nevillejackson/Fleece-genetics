# Fleece-genetics #
This project is about inheritance of measured fleece characteristics in sheep. It encompasses the genetic relationship between skin and fleece traits and their consequences for sheep breeding selection methods. It also encompasses analyses of selection responses in experimental flocks and in industry flocks.

## Quantitative genetics of wrinkle score in sheep ##
The subdirectory _qgwrinkle_ contains a document _qgwrinkle.pdf_ which is an analysis of quantitative genetic variation of wrinkle scores in Australian Merino sheep flocks. It includes a demonstration of the existence of additive x additive epistatic variance for wrinkle scores and an explanation for the developmental biology behind these epistatic effects. It also includes a suggestion of maternal additive genetic and/or maternal environmental effects.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of the inheritance of fleece characteristics and its consequences for sheep selection methods. This has to include fleece quality as well as quantity and an understanding of how the two should e put together in a selection goal.
