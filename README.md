# Fleece-genetics #
This project is about inheritance of measured fleece characteristics in sheep. It encompasses the genetic relationship between skin and fleece traits and their consequences for sheep breeding selection methods. It also encompasses analyses of selection responses in experimental flocks and in industry flocks.

## Skin and fleece parameters ##
The subdirectory _skinandfleeceparametrs/ab3220_ contains an analysis of an experimental flock  which was maintained by CSIRO over the period 1974-1984. It contains important measurements of the fibre diameters of primary and secondary fibres which are not available elsewhere, as well as a copmprehensive range of skin and fleece measurements.

Analyses from other flocks will be added to the _skinandfleeceparametrs_ subdirectory in due course

## Wrinkle genetics ##
The subdirectory _wrinkle_ contains a document _wrinkle.pdf_ which is a compendium of what is known about the genetics of wrinkle score in Merino sheep. It is meant to be the starting point for a broader investigation of all the factors involved in woolgrowing surface area of a sheep.

## Quantitative genetics of wrinkle score in sheep ##
The subdirectory _qgwrinkle_ contains a document _qgwrinkle.pdf_ which is an analysis of quantitative genetic variation of wrinkle scores in Australian Merino sheep flocks. It includes a demonstration of the existence of additive x additive epistatic variance for wrinkle scores and an explanation for the developmental biology behind these epistatic effects. It also includes a suggestion of maternal additive genetic and/or maternal environmental effects.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of the inheritance of fleece characteristics and its consequences for sheep selection methods. This has to include fleece quality as well as quantity and an understanding of how the two should e put together in a selection goal.
